      <h1>The Sliver</h1>
      <p>A glint of light, or the wavering shadow, a blot on the beauty of creation, a thin slight insignificant waif of melted, shaped, and jagged ship, stabs, sticks, and edges deeper through the gasses the contain all the ingredients for life. The ship is but a splinter that interrupts and annoys an otherwise undisturbed and perfected process; old life enters the process of creation and new life, and calls it good.</p>
      <p>The inhabitants of the ship are at their instruments, honing all of their sensors for the sacred wind which blew all of this with such a force, that it split the smallest structure, scattering, and creating all the known forces in the known and unknown void. They harness these forces, but are guided by that holy wind still; blown about the vastness of space at the edge of constant endurance.</p>
